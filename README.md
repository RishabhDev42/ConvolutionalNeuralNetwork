# Overview

This repository covers:

- **Implementing a CNN from scratch**
  - Implementing convolutional layers
  - Implementing pooling layers
  - Implementing downsampling and upsampling layers
  - Chaining these components to compose a CNN of any size

- **Forward Inference**
  - Enabling the code to perform forward inference through the CNN

- **Training a CNN**
  - Implementing a forward pass through the network
  - Implementing backpropagation through:
    - Convolutional layers
    - Pooling layers
    - Resampling (downsampling/upsampling) layers
  - Combining these components to perform backpropagation through the entire CNN
  - Computing gradients to train all parameters of the network
